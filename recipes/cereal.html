    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Cereal is a popular breakfast food typically made from 
        processed grains such as wheat, corn, oats, or rice. It 
        often comes in the form of flakes, puffs, or rings and is 
        usually sweetened or flavored with ingredients like sugar, 
        honey, chocolate, or fruit. Cereal is commonly eaten cold with 
        milk, yogurt, or a dairy alternative, though some people enjoy 
        it dry as a snack..
